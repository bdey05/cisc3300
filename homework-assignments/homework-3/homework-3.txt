Homework 3 

1. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they different? 

Flexbox and CSS grid are both layout systems that are used to position elements within a container element on a webpage. 
However, Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that can work with either a row or column while CSS grid is a two-dimensional layout system that can work with both rows and columns at the same time. 

2. Whatâ€™s responsive design in web development and how do we implement it? 

Responsive design in web development is an approach to creating web pages that dynamically adjust their view and design based on varying screen sizes and resolutions in order to ensure proper usability. 
In order to implement responsive design, developers can use media queries to target different device sizes and orientations. 
Additionally, developers can utilize modern layout systems like Flexbox and grid to create dynamically sized containers. 

3. Create a HTML file with a flex container and three flex items. Give the flex items a color and width/height of 100px. 
For screens <500px wide have the items flow vertically and >= 500px flow horizontally. 

4. Create a form with bootstrap, should have a few input elements, labels, and a submit button.
