Homework 2 

1. What do the id and class attributes do? How are they alike and different? 
The id attribute is used to assign a unique id to a single HTML element. 
The class attribute is used to assign a class for one or many HTML elements. 
The id and class attributes can both be targeted by their name when styling the element(s) using CSS or they can be used by JavaScript to manipulate the element(s). 
However, the value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document while multiple elements in the same HTML file can have the same class value.

2. What are the parts of a CSS rule? 
	
A CSS rule contains a selector and a declaration. 
The selector is used to choose which HTML elements you want to style. 
The declaration is made up of a property and value and it applies a visual effect to the selected element. 

3. Explain how CSS rules cascade. 

The CSS rules for cascading take effect when two or more rules apply to the same element. 
The “!important” keyword has the highest precedence. 
Then, there is specificity which means the CSS rule that has the highest specificity (the selector with the higher priority) will have its style declaration applied to the targeted HTML element.
Next, there is inheritance which means that a child element will inherit style properties from its parent element.
Lastly, there is the “last rule” which states that if there are two or more CSS rules on the same element, the rule applied last will be the one actually applied. 

4. Contrast display: block, inline, inline-block. 

Elements with block display (such as the <h1> and <p> elements) always appear on a new line.
Elements with inline display (such as the <b> and <img> elements) reside within a block level element and do not take up a new line.
Inline elements continue on the same line as neighboring elements.
Elements with inline-block display behave like inline elements in that they appear on the same line as neighboring elements.
However, they share the rest of their behavior with block level elements as you can set the height and width properties on the element.

5. What are border, padding, and margin? 

The border is the line that surrounds the edge of the element’s box.
The margin is the space around the element’s box and it sits outside of the border.
The padding is the space between the border of the element’s box and the content that is within the box.

6. Let’s improve our fake business webpage from the first homework: 
a. Make a full width header div with a centered row of links and a border. The links can route to ‘#’. Give the header a background color and the links a foreground color. 
b. Create a logo with a fancy font from google fonts and some color. And set a google font for the text of the rest of your webpage. 
c. Every item on the page should have adequate margin/padding. 
d. Try to think about the usability principles we have discussed in class; try to make the design choices increase the usability of the page.
